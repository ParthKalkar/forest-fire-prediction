# Predicting Forest Fire Confidence Levels

This is a machine learning model that predicts the confidence level of a forest fire using Random Forest Regression. The project is built in Python and uses sci-kit learn library. It is open-source and released under the MIT license. 

## Usage

The model can be run using Google Colab Jupyter Notebook. The required libraries are mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file. To install the libraries run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Building the Model

We start off by building a machine learning model using the Random Forest Regression. To find the best parameters, we use Random Search CV. The model is trained on a dataset of past forest fires and their respective confidence levels.

## Future Plans

This project is open for contributions and we plan on building a web application for this model to make it more accessible. 

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you want to contribute, please open an issue and let us know what you want to add or fix. We will review your pull requests as soon as possible.
